# React Flashcards App (Codecademy project)
This project is derived from a challenge project as part of the CodeCademy [Full Stack Engineer Course](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer/path/fscj-22-front-end-development/track/fscj-22-redux). This project uses React, Redux, and React-router.

Users can create topics and add quizzes to topics with flashcards attached to them. By selecting a quiz the user can flip over the flashcards associated with that quiz.
